     "SHOULD WE INCLUDE HTML , HEAD , BODY TAGS?"
	 
Most of the browser are capable of auto adding the optional tags (html ,head , body)
but the auto adding during interpreter would not be as same as defining it explicitly 
which might lead to confusion and increases the chances of unexpected delivery of our contents.
so , aadding the tags explicitly is always better than omitting in order to get the desired output.
