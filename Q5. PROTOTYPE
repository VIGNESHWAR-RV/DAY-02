     "PROTOTYPE"
	 
* PROTOTYPE contains pre-defined set of properties and methods for
 datatypes like (string,number,array,object) in javascript which 
 are accessible by those datatypes by default.
 
* And also we can create our custom methods and properties by using 
 prototype. ie We can create custom method for string prototype
 and can use it for every string datatypes.
* Prototypes will be useful when we use custom methods or properties for again
 and again for same datatype in our code and also we can inherit methods &
 properties from one to another of same datatypes.
